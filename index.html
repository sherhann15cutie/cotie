                <h3>Pancake ùúóùúö</h3>
                <p>A pancake is a flat, round, and fluffy cake made from a batter of flour, eggs, milk, sugar, and a leavening agent like baking powder. The batter is poured onto a hot griddle or frying pan and cooked until golden brown on both sides. Pancakes are enjoyed worldwide and vary in thickness, texture, and toppings depending on the region.

They are often served with sweet toppings such as syrup, butter, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or chocolate. Some variations include savory versions with ingredients like cheese, bacon, or herbs. Pancakes are a popular breakfast dish but can also be enjoyed as a dessert or snack.

                <h3>Mango float ‡±®‡ßé</h3>
                <p>Mango float, also known as mango graham cake or mango refrigerator cake, is a popular Filipino no-bake dessert made with layers of ripe mango slices, graham crackers, and a creamy mixture of condensed milk and all-purpose cream. The ingredients are assembled in a dish, with the crackers absorbing moisture from the cream, creating a soft, cake-like texture.

This dessert is typically chilled for several hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld together. The result is a sweet, creamy, and refreshing treat that highlights the tropical flavor of mangoes. It is commonly served during special occasions and gatherings in the Philippines.

                <h3>Letche flan ·ÅÑ·ÅÉ </h3>
                <p>Leche flan is a rich, creamy, and smooth custard dessert popular in the Philippines. It is made from egg yolks, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and sugar, with a layer of caramelized sugar on top. The dessert is similar to Spanish flan or cr√®me caramel but is denser due to the high egg yolk content.

The caramelized sugar forms a sweet, slightly bitter syrup that contrasts with the creamy custard. Leche flan is traditionally steamed in llaneras (oval aluminum molds) and served chilled, often as a special treat during celebrations and holidays.
